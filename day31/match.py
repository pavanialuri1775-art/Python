#Match statement:Instead of writing many if..else statements, we can use the match statement.
#The match statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed.
#this is how it works:
'''The match expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
