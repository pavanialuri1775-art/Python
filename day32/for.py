#for loop is used to iterate over a sequence(list,tuple,string)
#example
#print name of each person in a student list
names=["pavani","ammulu","puppy"]
for x in names:
    print(x)
    
#Looping Through a String
#Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters
#example
#Loop through the letters in the word "banana"
for x in "banana":
    print(x)
