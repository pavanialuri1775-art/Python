#There are several ways to join two or more sets in Python.
#The union() and update() methods joins all items from both sets.
#The intersection() method keeps ONLY the duplicates.
#The difference() method keeps the items from the first set that are not in the other set(s).
#The symmetric_difference() method keeps all items EXCEPT the duplicates.


#Union
#The union() method returns a new set with all items from both sets.
#Join set1 and set2 into a new set:
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)

#Use | to join two sets:
set1 = {"a", "b", "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set3 = set1 | set2
print(set3)
