#Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics
'''Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b'''
#we use these conditions in several ways most commonly in if statements
#if statement evaluates the condition and if the condition is true the code inside the if block is executed else If the condition is false, the code block is skipped.

#checking if a number is positive
number = 20
if number > 0:
  print("The number is positive")

#checking if b is greater than a
a = 33
b = 20
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
